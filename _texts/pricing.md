uSleep's default method of invoicing is time-based. We offer an hourly rate with no commitment. Invoices for billable time are sent at the end of the month, discounted 17% for net-10, otherwise net-30.

In addition to this, we offer a flat monthly rate based on an agreement with the client which can be paid monthly at any time. We encourage clients that regularly require 5 or more hours of work a month to open a dialogue with us. To speak plainly: we appreciate the repeat business and would love to work out a predictable monthly rate as it's mutually beneficial.
